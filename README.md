Python version of the JavaScript "normalizr" library, found here:
https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr

We built this library to bridge the gab between nested data sets from our API,
and flattened data sets more easily consumed by Flux based front ends.

This library was generously released as an Open Source project by Farmobile Inc.

Check out the [example.py](https://github.com/farmobile/norm/blob/master/example.py) file for usage info.
